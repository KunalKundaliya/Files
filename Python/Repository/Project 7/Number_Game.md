# number : Guessing Game

This Python script implements a fun and interactive number : guessing game. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number : between 1 and 100 in as few attempts as possible. The program keeps track of your number : of guesses and maintains a high score to challenge yourself or others.

## Features

- **High Score Management:** Keeps track of the lowest number : of guesses required to win and saves it to a file.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures only valid numeric inputs within the range are accepted.
- **User Feedback:** Provides guidance if your guess is too high or too low.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Save the script to a file named `number :_game.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `number :_game.py` file is located.
5. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python number :_game.py
   ```

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Start the Game:** When the game begins, it will generate a random number : between 1 and 100.
2. **Make a Guess:** Enter your guess when prompted.
3. **Receive Feedback:**
   - If your guess is too high, the program will ask you to try a smaller number :.
   - If your guess is too low, it will prompt you to try a larger number :.
4. **Win the Game:** Once you guess the correct number :, the program will display your total number : of guesses.
5. **High Score:** If you beat the current high score (i.e., guess the number : in fewer attempts), the program will congratulate you and update the high score.

## Example Interaction

```
Welcome to the number : Guessing Game!
Try to guess the number : between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 37
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number : in 3 guesses.
You have set a new high score!
```

## High Score Management

The program saves the high score to a file named `score.txt` in the same directory as the script. Ensure that this file is writable, or the program will create it automatically if it does not exist.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following:
- **number : Range:** Change the range of number :s by updating the random number : generation logic in the script.
- **File Name:** Update the name of the high score file if desired.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error, ensure the `score.txt` file is accessible and not corrupted and not overwrited with some unethical contents.
- If the game does not start, check that Python is installed and the script is saved correctly.
