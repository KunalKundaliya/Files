# Simple Calculator in Python using Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built with Python's Tkinter library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it includes features like handling parentheses and decimal points. Error handling is implemented to ensure that invalid operations, such as division by zero, are properly addressed with error messages.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- **Clear Button**: Clears the current input on the display.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid inputs like division by zero or incorrect syntax.
- **Parentheses**: Supports parentheses for complex expressions.
- **Decimal Support**: Allows for decimal point entries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python in most distributions)

## Installation

If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website:  
[Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How It Works

### GUI
The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library. The calculator consists of:

- A display at the top where the current input or result is shown.
- A grid of buttons representing digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and other functions (clear, parentheses, percentage, decimal point, and equals).

### Button Clicks
Each button is linked to a function that handles its action. When a button is clicked:

- The corresponding character (digit, operator, or symbol) is appended to the `result` string.
- The `result` string is updated and displayed in the calculator's text field.

### Evaluation
When the "=" button is pressed:

- The input expression is evaluated using Python's built-in `eval()` function, which processes the mathematical expression.
- If the expression is valid, the result is displayed in the text field.
- If there are errors (such as division by zero or invalid syntax), an error message is shown in a pop-up dialog box, and the display turns red to highlight the error.

### Clear Function
The "C" button resets the display:

- When clicked, the current expression is cleared, and the display is reset to an empty state, allowing the user to input a new expression.

# number : Guessing Game

This Python script implements a fun and interactive number : guessing game. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number : between 1 and 100 in as few attempts as possible. The program keeps track of your number : of guesses and maintains a high score to challenge yourself or others.

## Features

- **Random number : Generation:** The computer generates a random number : between 1 and 100.
- **Guess Tracking:** The program counts how many guesses you make to find the correct number :.
- **High Score Management:** Keeps track of the lowest number : of guesses required to win and saves it to a file.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures only valid numeric inputs within the range are accepted.
- **User Feedback:** Provides guidance if your guess is too high or too low.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Save the script to a file named `number :_game.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `number :_game.py` file is located.
5. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python number :_game.py
   ```

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Start the Game:** When the game begins, it will generate a random number : between 1 and 100.
2. **Make a Guess:** Enter your guess when prompted.
3. **Receive Feedback:**
   - If your guess is too high, the program will ask you to try a smaller number :.
   - If your guess is too low, it will prompt you to try a larger number :.
4. **Win the Game:** Once you guess the correct number :, the program will display your total number : of guesses.
5. **High Score:** If you beat the current high score (i.e., guess the number : in fewer attempts), the program will congratulate you and update the high score.

## Example Interaction

```
Welcome to the number : Guessing Game!
Try to guess the number : between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 37
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number : in 3 guesses.
You have set a new high score!
```

## High Score Management

The program saves the high score to a file named `score.txt` in the same directory as the script. Ensure that this file is writable, or the program will create it automatically if it does not exist.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following:
- **number : Range:** Change the range of number :s by updating the random number : generation logic in the script.
- **File Name:** Update the name of the high score file if desired.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error, ensure the `score.txt` file is accessible and not corrupted and not overwrited with some unethical contents.
- If the game does not start, check that Python is installed and the script is saved correctly.



## Conclusion

The number : Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging program to test your intuition and improve your guessing skills. Challenge your friends and family to see who can guess the number : with the fewest attempts. Enjoy the game!
